When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when working on a group share or when offsite backup is needed.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When I want a stable environment.  When I'm doing dev. and don't
    want the code base to change

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork creates a copy of someone else's repos in your own github
    	repos.  Where you can safely make updates without interfering
    	with the original.
    Clone creates a copy of one of your own repos. on github down on
    	your local machine.
    Branch creates a an offshoot from the master that may or may not be
    	merged back into the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Rest of the team can make updates to the main repos. and you don't
    have to worry about it destabilizing what your doing.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    There would be a lot of e-mailing of code back and forth.  Probably
    missing code as well.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When working on a team project or a project where I have to maintain
    a "production" or stable code base to work off of then I would make
    a branch for my own development being able to go back to the base if
    I should have to "recover" code.
